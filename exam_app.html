Despite these successes, the EA team has not been involved in defining strategies for the Digital Transformation initiative. Recently, there has been an increasing number of requests from the product development teams and the user experience (UX) team for architecture support. These requests highlight a need for integrating advanced analytics, personalization features, and improved scalability to better serve the growing online customer base. However, the EA team has been referring these experiments to external consultants due to a perceived lack of internal expertise in these specific areas."

In previous architectural projects, you worked with external cloud platforms to develop a reference model for the banking capabilities, data flows, logical application models, and security architecture. You are currently updating the in-house digital banking roadmap. There are three primary stakeholder groups: the digital banking product managers (focused on speed to market), the operations team (focused on customer satisfaction), and corporate IT (focused on reducing long-term costs). From earlier work on the digital transformation strategy, it was clear that stakeholders were comfortable experimenting with cloud-based solutions but still preferred to retain control over the in-house banking platform. A critical consideration is meeting global regulatory requirements, including data sovereignty for customer information in specific regions. The EA team leader has met with key stakeholders and confirmed that customer satisfaction goals must be met before any new releases can proceed.

The company is undergoing a large-scale digital transformation, enabling all of its product lines to offer digital services alongside their existing physical products. Recently, you completed a significant update to the company's customer management strategy, expanding it to include digital services. As part of this update, you implemented a transition architecture to sustain the core global CRM, while allowing specific digital teams to manage their own CRM systems. Key elements of your architecture include strategies for phasing out legacy systems, global security protocols, and protection of the company's digital brand identity. During a strategy meeting, the EA team leader brings up a critical issue regarding one of the external platforms being used for digital services. The platform, which includes a high-performing AI assistant, is found to have compliance issues related to user data privacy and regional regulations. The AI assistant has been instrumental in increasing customer engagement and boosting sales by 35% month-over-month. However, to protect the company's brand and legal standing, the leadership team is considering halting product development on this platform until a solution is found. They are eager to salvage the digital product and maintain its success."

The team has initiated work into the architecting of service delivery processes and customer experience. Within your personal area of responsibility, the Customer Management System (CMS), you are working to develop an architecture that supports a radically different customer experience and engagement model. For example, the old CMS workflows assume that service issues must be reported via phone and an on-site visit scheduled for resolution. This assumption is not valid for digital energy monitoring services or remote diagnostics. You have identified the following stakeholders and concerns (drawn from the TOGAF Series Guide: A Practitioners' Approach to Developing Enterprise Architecture Following the TOGAF® ADM, Appendices B & C): (Customer) Traditional energy service customer, (Customer) Digital energy service customer, (Business Partner) Traditional energy service distributor, (Business Requirements Owner) Call-center Operations Leaders. Two of your core Architecture Concerns are: Change Impact (Business Partner & Business Requirements Owner), Value Proposition (Customer & Business Requirements Owner). You are going to identify deficiencies in your current customer engagement from the perspective of each stakeholder, then identify changes that will address the deficiencies. You will then identify any changes that conflict or create a deficiency for a different stakeholder. For each of the changes that is in conflict or creates a new deficiency, you will perform analysis to put the conflict in comparable terms of value delivery, work, and uncertainty to achieve the value.

After steady growth and successful brick-and-mortar operations, the Board of Directors has approved a plan to expand into direct online sales. Previously, online orders were handled through third-party marketplaces, but now the company aims to create its own e-commerce platform. To accomplish this, an Enterprise Architecture project has been launched to plan and manage the transition. The Board has set an aggressive 24-month timeline for the first phase, which focuses on establishing a functional online sales system for 30 pilot stores. The project needs to evaluate how the existing physical infrastructure and business processes can be adapted for digital operations. The company uses the TOGAF Standard as its Enterprise Architecture framework. The CIO sponsors the project. The key architecture domains have been developed, and stakeholders generally agree on the tasks needed for the transition. A Baseline Business Architecture already exists, which includes business capabilities, process flows, and a value stream map. A critical issue for the project is migrating from a store-centric inventory system to one that can handle online orders and fulfillment. The CIO has raised the option of purchasing a Commercial Off-the-Shelf (COTS) solution from a well-established e-commerce provider.
