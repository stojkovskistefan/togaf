**Scenario Summary:**  
You are a senior architect working with the Enterprise Architecture (EA) team at a multinational technology company. The company is undergoing a large-scale digital transformation, enabling all of its product lines to offer digital services alongside their existing physical products. Recently, you completed a significant update to the company's customer management strategy, expanding it to include digital services. As part of this update, you implemented a transition architecture to sustain the core global CRM, while allowing specific digital teams to manage their own CRM systems. Key elements of your architecture include strategies for phasing out legacy systems, global security protocols, and protection of the company's digital brand identity. During a strategy meeting, the EA team leader brings up a critical issue regarding one of the external platforms being used for digital services. The platform, which includes a high-performing AI assistant, is found to have compliance issues related to user data privacy and regional regulations. The AI assistant has been instrumental in increasing customer engagement and boosting sales by 35% month-over-month. However, to protect the company's brand and legal standing, the leadership team is considering halting product development on this platform until a solution is found. They are eager to salvage the digital product and maintain its success.

**Question:**  
The EA team leader informs you that the product team is fully available for consultation and requests you to summarize the next steps for advising the key stakeholders. Which of the following is the best answer?

A. The system choices include adopting a new platform, making a revolutionary change to the in-house platform, or adapting the product for either of the available platforms. You should refer to the transition architecture as it accounts for data protection, brand integrity, and exiting from disposable systems. A crucial factor is assessing the current workload and capability of the in-house team. You will visually document the risks, opportunities, and required work for each option to help stakeholders make an informed decision.

B. The system choices involve making revolutionary changes to either align the digital product with your in-house platform or migrate it to another third-party platform. A major consideration is the potential to enhance the in-house platform to maximize the value of this opportunity. The product team must recognize that a revolutionary transformation is needed to accommodate either platform. This is a strong opportunity to advance your in-house capabilities with both Al technology and enhanced analytics that could be useful in future projects.

C. The system choices include using a greenfield approach with a completely new platform, undertaking a revolutionary change to the in-house platform, or radically modifying the product to work with either of the two available platforms. You advise that an evolutionary approach is not suitable in this case. A significant consideration will be the available resources of the in-house platform team. Each choice presents different levels of risk and opportunity, and you will document these for stakeholders.

D. The system choices involve either a revolutionary change to integrate the product with the in-house platform or using another third-party platform. A key concern is the current capacity and resources of the in-house platform team. Although it would be beneficial to extend the in-house platform, the risks are too high as the product team has primarily worked with commercial platforms, and the in-house system lacks mature processes and documentation. You should document the option of transitioning to the other third-party platform.

**Question 2 (Exam 6, Q2):**
**Scenario Summary:**  
You are a new solutions architect working within the Enterprise Architecture (EA) team at a multinational energy company, EnergySolutions Inc. You have joined the EA team while it is in transition to better support the Digital Transformation. You have experience with digital services and have been hired to extend the capability of the EA team. The EA team is now engaged in the Digital Transformation initiative, and an architecture has been developed to support the strategy, with a supporting roadmap. The team has initiated work into the architecting of service delivery processes and customer experience. Within your personal area of responsibility, the Customer Management System (CMS), you are working to develop an architecture that supports a radically different customer experience and engagement model. For example, the old CMS workflows assume that service issues must be reported via phone and an on-site visit scheduled for resolution. This assumption is not valid for digital energy monitoring services or remote diagnostics. You have identified the following stakeholders and concerns (drawn from the TOGAF Series Guide: A Practitioners' Approach to Developing Enterprise Architecture Following the TOGAF® ADM, Appendices B & C): (Customer) Traditional energy service customer, (Customer) Digital energy service customer, (Business Partner) Traditional energy service distributor, (Business Requirements Owner) Call-center Operations Leaders. Two of your core Architecture Concerns are: Change Impact (Business Partner & Business Requirements Owner), Value Proposition (Customer & Business Requirements Owner). You are going to identify deficiencies in your current customer engagement from the perspective of each stakeholder, then identify changes that will address the deficiencies. You will then identify any changes that conflict or create a deficiency for a different stakeholder. For each of the changes that is in conflict or creates a new deficiency, you will perform analysis to put the conflict in comparable terms of value delivery, work, and uncertainty to achieve the value. [Note: The EA team has adopted the role definitions in the TOGAF Series Guide: A Practitioners' Approach to Developing Enterprise Architecture Following the TOGAF® ADM, Section 15.2]

**Question:**  
You have been asked how you will address conflict in preferences for customer engagement?

A. You will focus on facilitating between the different stakeholders to gain an understanding of value preference and priority as well as the scope of change. You will use stakeholder agents for the customer and business partner. Conflict within one stakeholder's preferences is resolved with that stakeholder. Conflict between stakeholders will be resolved by reference to the superior architecture, or by relaxing one or more preferences until an acceptable answer is reached.

B. You will focus on the choices based on your understanding of the superior architecture. You will use reference material from the TOGAF Library, including the white paper, the Seven Levers of Digital Transformation, to provide external guidance of items that are critical for success, notably Customer Experience and Engagement. Conflict between stakeholders will be resolved in priority of the customer, business requirements owners, and then business partners.

C. You will focus on facilitating understanding of value, work to realize, and risk of failing. You will use the service product owners to provide decisions when there is a trade-off to make between preferences of the customers and business partners. Conflict between stakeholders will be resolved either by superior architecture providing a priority to a stakeholder or concern, or by relaxing one or more preferences until you reach an acceptable answer.

D. You will focus on pushing to resolve each conflict and produce an answer. You draw up a Stakeholder/Concern matrix using the existing Stakeholder Map from the CMS architecture. You will also use the existing CMS architecture to provide constraining decisions and set priorities for addressing conflicts between stakeholder preferences. Conflict between stakeholder preferences will be resolved in priority of the importance of the stakeholder as identified in the Stakeholder Map.

**Answer:** A

**Explanation:**
TOGAF recommends facilitating between stakeholders to understand value preferences and priorities. Conflicts are resolved by reference to the superior architecture or by relaxing preferences until an acceptable solution is found, ensuring balanced stakeholder concerns.

To accomplish this, an Enterprise Architecture project has been launched to plan and manage the transition. The Board has set an aggressive 24-month timeline for the first phase, which focuses on establishing a functional online sales system for 30 pilot stores. The project needs to evaluate how the existing physical infrastructure and business processes can be adapted for digital operations. The company uses the TOGAF Standard as its Enterprise Architecture framework. The CIO sponsors the project. The key architecture domains have been developed, and stakeholders generally agree on the tasks needed for the transition. A Baseline Business Architecture already exists, which includes business capabilities, process flows, and a value stream map. A critical issue for the project is migrating from a store-centric inventory system to one that can handle online orders and fulfillment. The CIO has raised the option of purchasing a Commercial Off-the-Shelf (COTS) solution from a well-established e-commerce provider. However, there are concerns about how well the packaged solution will integrate with the retailer's existing infrastructure.

**Question:**  
The EA team leader asks you to explain how you will identify the required changes in the Business Architecture. Based on the TOGAF Standard, which of the following is the best answer?

A. You would model the current business state using techniques such as value streams, business capabilities, and organization maps. You would focus on enhancing the existing business capabilities and value streams as outlined in the baseline architecture. This would enable you to identify where changes are required to meet the Target Architecture

B. You would request detailed documentation from the vendor about the COTS solution and identify the changes required to align it with your current systems. You would sequence the necessary changes into an Architecture Roadmap and ensure value is delivered incrementally. You would also contact other users of the solution to verify whether the vendor can meet your delivery timeline and service requirements.

C. You would review the current architecture descriptions to ensure they reflect the existing state of the enterprise. Then, you would develop architecture descriptions for the Target Architecture, including new value streams for online sales. You would create a capability map linked to those value streams and perform a gap analysis to determine which capabilities need to change.

D. You would determine where the business processes, organizational structure, and current capabilities do not support the proposed digital expansion. This would allow you to identify the necessary changes and the work required to implement them. You would present the change options to stakeholders, providing an analysis of the costs involved. You would also identify where trade-off decisions are necessary and collaborate with stakeholders to resolve them.

**Answer:** C

**Explanation:**  
TOGAF recommends reviewing current and target architectures, developing value streams and capability maps, and performing gap analysis to identify required changes. This ensures the architecture supports digital expansion and aligns with business goals.

**Question 4 (Exam 6, Q4):**
**Scenario Summary:**  
You are a senior architect working with the Enterprise Architecture (EA) team at the multinational healthcare firm, MediHealth Inc. You are responsible for the CRM roadmap at the portfolio level. The initial experiments of the Digital Transformation have been successful. The organization has successfully delivered digital health services. One of the experiments is now delivering 10% of corporate revenue and is projected to grow 100% this year. The system supporting the most successful digital product is the online chat/email-based contact center that is integrated with the go-forward digital platform. This solution was hastily assembled from a mixture of commercial applications and SaaS tools. It has limited support for data analytics, marketing, promotions, and patient engagement. You have completed delivery of your annual CRM roadmap. The projects to improve efficiency have been approved, and one of the projects to extend the system into a new country to support the unique local needs of healthcare regulations is completing. Between the work to develop the annual roadmap and provide implementation governance to the expansion into a new country, you have been very busy. Looking forward, one of the efficiency improvement projects will be very complex with significant process and system changes to enable chat and email contact with the customer service agents.

**Question:**  
You meet with the EA Team leader to discuss the status of your work. She notes that neither you nor the EA Team can sustain how the experiments were handled. She asks what you are going to change to ensure you and the team can meet expectations? Which of the following is the best answer?

A. You explain that you are going to improve the documentation and support available to the implementation team, particularly for the Architecture Requirements Specification and controls.

As soon as the Project and Solution Delivery-level artifacts have been provided to the implementation team, you will be free to focus on developing a target architecture for a combined digital/physical healthcare world.

B. You explain that improving sustainability requires not building technical debt right now. When the company followed a strategy of enabling experiments, they created an ad hoc coordination burden. Due to the complex situation, it is better to deal with the technical debt as soon as possible, and address it at the architecture level. You must stay directly engaged in implementation governance of these projects. You will guide the addition of chat and email to the global system so the CRM architecture can better support digital products.

C. You explain that the best approach given the situation is for you to stop work on the CRM Roadmap and focus entirely on implementation governance for the major efficiency project. Adding chat and email to the global system is going to have major process, staffing, and system implications. It will be important to support solution delivery by providing the controls and architecture requirements used to test conformance. You will also facilitate governance of the implementation and operational changes.

D. You explain that you are going to need support to ensure you have the gaps, work packages, Architecture Requirements Specification, and controls documented so that you do not need to be directly engaged in the implementation project. The digital product changes and ad hoc approaches in this experimental phase are creating barriers to future support of digital health services. You are going to need to focus on developing a target architecture for a combined digital/physical healthcare world. The stakeholders will need to bring together the resources to manage change.

**Answer:** B

**Explanation:**  
TOGAF recommends addressing technical debt early and staying engaged in implementation governance. This ensures the architecture remains sustainable and supports both digital and physical healthcare needs.

The EA team leader emphasizes the need to ensure the organization's Enterprise Architecture capability is aligned with the firm's changing digital strategy.

**Question:**  
During the meeting, the EA team leader asks you how you plan to update your approach to the PLM roadmap. She also notes that the approach should maintain continuity with existing analyses but address the evolving needs of the digital strategy at a portfolio level. What is your answer, and where would you seek guidance?

A. You would frame trade-offs between retaining a single shared product-master repository versus creating product-line-specific repositories. Each path has implications for data integration, duplication, and IP protection. You will develop a candidate architecture and capability-gap analysis so executives can judge the opportunities and risks, shaping enterprise-wide decisions on product-data governance.

B. You would immediately design a radically new PLM architecture because the current shared model "won't work" for mixed physical-digital offerings. You would also redesign the EA Repository/meta-model from scratch and rely on the TOGAF® Information Architecture guide to integrate all downstream service platforms and mitigate personal-data risks.

C. You would broaden your existing risk analysis to cover uncertainties introduced by digital product lifecycles. As product usage and telemetry data multiply across new touchpoints, you will evaluate information-security and compliance risks, define success metrics for product-usage engagement, and identify capability gaps in the PLM landscape. For guidance you will consult the TOGAF® Library's Digital Business Reference Model and Seven Levers of Digital Transformation, which address data-driven product innovation, secure sharing of product information, and governance at portfolio scale.

D. You would address product data security by reworking the EA Repository and meta-model to handle more detailed data capture across multiple lifecycle stages and digital touchpoints. By applying controls for data interchange and protection across the PLM ecosystem, you'll reduce security risks. The PLM platform will need enhancements to support digital product characteristics (like software versions, usage data), and you will guide improvements as the digital product strategies stabilize.

**Answer:** C

**Explanation:**
TOGAF recommends broadening risk analysis to cover new uncertainties, defining success metrics, identifying capability gaps, and consulting reference models like the Digital Business Reference Model. This ensures the roadmap addresses both current and future needs.

**Question 7 (Exam 6, Q7):**
**Scenario Summary:**  
You are a senior architect on the Enterprise Architecture (EA) team at a multinational electronics firm. You are responsible for overseeing the Customer Experience (CX) roadmap at a portfolio level. The early stages of the company's digital transformation have gone well, with digital services making significant strides. One of these new digital services, an AI-based support chatbot, now accounts for 15% of the company's customer interactions and is expected to grow rapidly. The current system, which manages this successful digital product, integrates a mixture of legacy tools and modern software-as-a-service (SaaS) applications. However, it was rapidly deployed and lacks sufficient functionality for analytics, marketing automation, and sales integration. You have just wrapped up the annual update to the CX roadmap, and several projects aimed at optimizing the system for better performance and scaling have been approved. One project is focused on extending this system to a new region to accommodate local compliance and customer support requirements. Looking ahead, the next wave of improvements will require substantial updates to enable seamless integration of email and chat support for global customer service operations.

**Question:**  
You are in a meeting with the EA Team leader, who asks about your progress and your proposed next steps for the Customer Experience roadmap. How do you envision your role in this process moving forward? Which of the following is the best answer?

A. You explain that the next year will be very demanding. Integrating chat and email into the global support system will require substantial process, staffing, and system changes. You expect to be heavily involved in implementation governance and, with these new capabilities, may expand the CX architecture to better align with digital services.

B. You explain that it's important to first gather feedback from stakeholders regarding their priorities, preferences, and value assessments. Without this input, you may become too focused on managing the process and resource challenges of integrating chat and email, leaving little time to strategize around future CX architecture improvements.

C. You explain that the next year will involve managing a heavy workload. The integration of chat and email will have significant implications for staffing, processes, and systems. While overseeing implementation governance, you plan to engage with CX stakeholders to decide on the appropriate timing for expanding the architecture to better support digital products.

D. You explain that your focus will need to be on implementation governance for the upcoming complex project, especially adding email and chat integration. This project will require major changes to staffing, process flows, and system infrastructure. Based on lessons learned from last year's roadmap cycle, you plan to begin the roadmap update process earlier this time.

**Answer:** C

**Explanation:**
TOGAF recommends balancing implementation governance with ongoing stakeholder engagement. Managing workload and engaging stakeholders ensures the architecture continues to evolve and support digital products.

**Question 8 (Exam 6, Q8):**
**Scenario Summary:**  
You are an Architect working with the Enterprise Architecture team for a government health services agency. The agency is responsible for building online digital platforms, products, and services that help create a simple, integrated, and personalized healthcare experience for its end users. Programs are funded in an annual budget cycle, and legislation aimed at controlling IT costs mandates the use of a shared government Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) and common systems. The Enterprise Architecture team uses the TOGAF Standard as the basis for its practice and reports directly to the Executive Director of the agency. The team is engaged in a major initiative to develop an electronic health records (EHR) system for use in future local and national healthcare facilities. This system will supplement current methods of maintaining health records, including paper files and disparate electronic systems. It will allow patients to access their health records via the Internet. Ensuring patient data privacy and security is a key challenge. The Enterprise Architecture team leader has returned from a meeting where it was revealed that an individual can currently have multiple incompatible health records within different government agencies. Concerns around data breaches, security risks, and privacy violations were discussed, as well as worries that certain groups might be excluded due to technology requirements. It was noted that four agencies have been attempting to unify health records for several years but have made little progress. The Information Architect within the team has identified two options for managing health records. At first glance, the options appear to be competing. The first is to introduce a new centralized health record system optimized for the EHR initiative; the second is to develop a federated model for health records that can also support existing records across multiple agencies.

**Question:**  
Refer to the Scenario. You have been asked by the Enterprise Architecture team leader how you would select the best option for the EHR initiative. Based on the TOGAF Standard, which of the following is the best answer?

A. You would start by identifying the key stakeholders and their concerns. You assess the impact of the 2 options in each architecture domain. In addition to collaborating with other domain architects, you will work with subject matter experts in the EHR initiative and the four agencies. You will evaluate the implications regarding the program's ability to meet its objectives, as well as risks and security concerns in all domain Architectures. You will facilitate the stakeholders in selecting their preferred option by balancing different concerns, required changes, costs, and benefits.

B. You would start by identifying the EHR initiative's stakeholders and leads from the four agencies. Working with key subject matter experts involved in information and digital service implementation, you will assess the two options. Together with these experts, you will use the architecture trade-off method to define alternatives based on the options. After listing the advantages and disadvantages of each, you will select the best option, integrate it into the Implementation and Migration Plan, explain it to stakeholders and agency leads, and oversee its implementation.

C. You would begin by identifying the stakeholders and key subject matter experts deeply involved in data management. Recognizing that many stakeholders undervalue and under-engage in information-based issues, you will need to find stakeholder agents. You will assess the impact of the options on the EHR initiative and existing systems at the 4 agencies. Collaborating with subject matter experts in the EHR initiative and the 4 impacted agencies, you will assess security concerns for both the federated and new centralized system. You will then select the best option and propose it.

D. You would start by identifying the new digital service's stakeholders and their concerns. Using the TOGAF Series Guide: "A Practitioner's Approach to..." as a starting point for stakeholder concerns, you assess the impact of the 2 options on the EHR initiative and existing IT systems at the 4 agencies. Collaborating with subject matter experts in the EHR initiative and the 4 impacted agencies, you will assess security concerns in all domain Architectures. You will work with stakeholders to balance different concerns, required changes, costs, and benefits, allowing them to select an option.

**Answer:** A. You would start by identifying the key stakeholders and their concerns. You assess the impact of the 2 options in each architecture domain.
