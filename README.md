PART 2

EXAM 4

W Question 1:

Scenario Summary

You are a lead architect working with the Enterprise Architecture (EA) team at a multinational financial services firm called FinServ Corp. Your personal responsibility within the EA team is the customer loyalty platform.

The EA team has received several requests for architecture work from the marketing and digital customer experience teams, but the assessment has been that the EA team does not have the capability to assist. Consequently, the marketing team was advised to seek help externally by using consultants more experienced with digital marketing and customer loyalty platforms.

One of the Marketing Managers has raised a concern that the consultants in their proposal have not addressed the business need to sustain existing sales channels. Instead, the proposal has focused on experiments in digital marketing strategies and customer engagement. In addition, the Marketing Manager wants to know how to address fundamental changes in customer engagement for one of the experiments. For example, existing loyalty program workflows assume a static reward structure, which won’t be effective for dynamic, personalized reward campaigns.

Question Text

You have been asked how the EA team can be engaged to support the transformation and address the concerns raised by the Marketing Manager?

Which of the following is the best answer?

• You recommend that a new architecture project be scoped and the EA team
engaged to take on the work. You would create a change request to leverage
the established multi-product loyalty platform and identify changes for it to
support personalized reward campaigns. Then you will focus the architecture
development project to address fundamental customer engagement changes
with digital rewards, such as how to manage dynamic reward structures.

You recommend that the EA team be engaged to take a broader approach
that addresses the entire customer engagement strategy. You review if the correct stakeholders have been identified, and if not, engage them. You
recommend that the EA team's capabilities be strengthened by the addition
of specialist subject matter experts to develop architecture models and
analyze gaps. This will form the basis of a renewed architecture development
project.


• You recommend reviewing where the Marketing Manager is dissatisfied with
the consultant's proposal. You will then review the assessments made of the
EA team to identify the gaps in capability that need to be addressed. The EA
team can then be engaged to determine the gaps in scope for the project. The
gaps will form the basis of the architecture development project.

You recommend extending the loyalty platform to support direct-to-
consumer digital rewards. You will review the existing Application
Architecture and define the capabilities needed to support a direct-to- consumer relationship. This will require new interfaces to enable dynamic
rewards. You will check with the Marketing Manager for additional
requirements. You will recommend that the loyalty platform roadmap be
adjusted to add these new capabilities to the shared loyalty platform.

Question 2:
Scenario Summary

You are a lead architect working with the Enterprise Architecture (EA) team at the multinational healthcare technology firm, HealthTech Inc. Your personal responsibility within the EA team is the patient engagement platform with an architecture to support portfolio approach. The ongoing roadmap for the patient engagement platform is focused on incremental efficiency gains with healthcare providers and providing localized health monitoring services with changes for language, different healthcare regulations, and integrated telemedicine support.



As part of the ongoing Digital Transformation, two of the product lines have now released digital health services and virtual consultations surrounding traditional healthcare services. Both product lines have faced difficulty managing subscriptions and follow-up consultations in the patient engagement platform.



The Product Manager is responsible for a new health service that will be offered directly to patients. It has been proposed that this be supported by a stand-alone patient engagement system that supports direct engagement with patients. The Product Manager is concerned about the long-term architecture, especially given that in the future, physical and digital health services will share the same patient interaction and support channels.



Question Text

You have been asked how to address the concerns raised by the Product Manager?



Which of the following is the best answer?

• You recommend an architecture development project is established to
explore short-term workarounds that support digital health service
subscriptions and follow-up consultations. Once you understand the short-
term workarounds, you will ensure the patient engagement platform
roadmap includes work packages to bring the short-term workarounds into
the shared platform so that it can continue to support all service lines,
whether digital, physical, or hybrid.

You recommend that an architecture development project identify multiple
options for the patient engagement platform. Each of these candidate architectures will be optimized for different stakeholder concerns. A key
element of the different candidate architectures will be linking decisions and
outcomes so that you can develop a set of transitions that minimize the
uncertainty of achieving different objectives.

You recommend commencing an architecture development project to explore
the options that would lead to a standardized patient engagement platform
suitable for both physical and digital health services. For the candidate
architectures identified, you recommend adopting those that match prior
decisions that have impacted patient engagement efficiency and fit with the
current roadmap. You will publish this roadmap to the EA Repository.

You recommend establishing an architecture development project to provide
standardized APls for accessing the shared patient engagement platform.
This will provide a reliable service that can be accessed by the digital health service experiments. These API interfaces should draw on available industry
standard approaches to support a long-term solution. This can be added to
the existing patient engagement platform roadmap while protecting the
planned efficiency gains.

Question 3:
You are the Lead Architect at a global pharmaceutical company, XedMedCo. The company has research labs in 15 countries and distributes its products worldwide. It operates under four main divisions, each focusing on a different therapeutic area. Each division has historically functioned autonomously, with distinct research methodologies and minimal shared data. However, they all report financial and HR metrics to the central corporate office.



A recent proposal from an external consultancy suggests a restructuring to promote the sharing of research data across divisions. This would necessitate the creation of unified research data systems and patient trial databases.



XedMedCo has a well-established Enterprise Architecture practice, grounded in the TOGAF Standard. The CIO sponsors the Enterprise Architecture initiative. A Statement of Architecture Work has been greenlit, and the Enterprise Architecture team has secured the consensus of primary stakeholders to devise a Target Architecture to validate the proposed benefits. Several domain architectures have been ratified, revealing a set of gaps.



During the latest executive meeting, which included representatives from all divisions, concerns were voiced about the potential risks and security implications of this cross-divisional data sharing initiative.



Question



Given the Scenario, you are tasked with suggesting a strategy to address the raised apprehensions. Based on the TOGAF Standard, which of the following would be the most appropriate recommendation?

You advocate for a secure migration process that encompasses both a risk
assessment and a Risk Mitigation Plan. This should involve a detailed risk
classification system and the completion of risk assessment templates. This
approach would allow for a thorough evaluation of the risks linked with the proposed organizational transformation. The migration strategy should
integrate a security impact analysis, ensuring a clear understanding of the
initial risk level before finalizing the Architecture Contracts.

You propose revisiting the Architecture Development Method (ADM) up to the
Architecture Vision phase and categorizing risks based on their potential
impact on time, cost, and scope. This would ensure that risks of specific
types are managed by the appropriate personnel. Subsequently, during the Implementation Governance phase, the Architecture Contracts should
address these primary risks and incorporate robust risk monitoring
measures.

You suggest outlining the Architecture Roadmap and assessing the security
and risk implications for the identified gaps. The value, effort, and associated
risk of each change and work package should be determined. It's essential to
address stakeholders' security and risk concerns and ensure that the work
packages provide value, including security and risk metrics. A Risk Mitigation
Plan should be developed to counter potential risks arising from the new
architectural setup.

You advise that a comprehensive security orientation and training be given to
the deployment team to ensure the accurate setup, configuration, and
management of the new systems. During the Data Architecture phase, risk
mitigation strategies should be employed to gauge the organization's risk
tolerance. If the perceived risk exceeds the organization's comfort level, a recommendation to deploy redundant systems as a risk countermeasure
should be made.

Question 4:
Scenario Summary:

You are a Senior Architect working with the Enterprise Architecture team at a multinational retail company. The company has historically focused on physical retail operations, but it is now undergoing a significant Digital Transformation to expand its e-commerce presence and integrate digital services with its physical store network.

Your current focus is on updating the Order Fulfillment System, which includes both physical and digital fulfillment processes. A recent review identified key stakeholder motivations: reducing order processing time (time-to-market), improving customer satisfaction (customer experience), and minimizing ongoing operational costs (sustained cost).

The review also highlighted that the current fulfillment value streams and data flows are inefficient, leading to delays in order processing and dissatisfaction with delivery times. Although stakeholders agree that improving the customer experience is critical, the system’s complexity and its reliance on legacy IT infrastructure drive up costs significantly.

Question Text:

The Enterprise Architecture team leader asks what you need to know to address the motivation to reduce sustained costs while improving the Order Fulfillment System. Based on the TOGAF Standard, which of the following is the best answer?

You would evaluate where the Application Architecture and Data Architecture
fail to meet the objectives of faster order processing, improved customer
satisfaction, and lower costs. You would focus on logical components and
identify the necessary changes to the system. Finally, you would work with
stakeholders to prioritize these changes based on their impact on time-to-
market, customer satisfaction, and cost reduction.

You would analyze the current Application Architecture and Data Architecture to identify where the system's information flows and value streams create
inefficiencies. You would identify incremental changes to improve the
system's performance, focusing on improving customer experience while
addressing the costs associated with system sustainment. You would also
evaluate the one-time and ongoing costs of these changes and assess
whether stakeholders believe the benefits outweigh the costs.

You would identify where the Application Architecture, specifically the logical
components and services, fails to support timely order processing and leads
to higher costs. You would determine the necessary changes to the system's
data flows that would enable faster processing times and improve customer
satisfaction while reducing costs. Finally, you would gather stakeholder input
on prioritizing improvements to the value streams and data flows to achieve
these goals.

You would model the current state of the fulfillment system's application and
data components, then develop a Target Architecture that focuses on
reducing order processing time and operational costs. You would create views to describe how the future state will improve efficiency, then identify the gaps between the current and target states to generate a roadmap of
required changes.

Question 5:
Scenario Summary:

You are a senior enterprise architect working with the IT architecture team at a global financial services company. The company has successfully implemented the initial phases of its Digital Banking Transformation strategy, enabling it to offer a range of digital services across multiple banking divisions.

The company's architecture now includes the following systems:

A traditional branch-based CRM system for customer engagement and product sales, focusing on in-branch interactions and loan services. The CRM is heavily reliant on manual processes and direct human interaction.

A web-based customer service CRM, designed for online banking customers. This CRM allows customers to manage their accounts and request support online but has limited features for cross-channel promotions or personalized offers.

A chatbot and AI-powered CRM that supports customer interactions via chat and mobile apps. This system offers advanced data analytics and can handle basic inquiries and transactions but is limited in its ability to handle complex banking requests.

A legacy call center CRM system, which supports customers calling into the bank for inquiries, but the system is not integrated with newer digital channels, creating gaps in customer service and data consistency.

As part of the digital transformation initiative, the company is now moving forward with integrating all of its CRM systems into a unified customer engagement platform. You are responsible for updating the CRM architecture to support both physical and digital banking services, taking into account the core motivations of key stakeholders: the digital product managers, focused on time-to-market; the branch operations team, focused on improving customer satisfaction; and the corporate IT team, driven by cost optimization.

Question Text:

Given that the core motivations of the key stakeholders have been identified, the IT architecture team leader asks you how to develop the target business architecture for the unified customer engagement platform.

Which of the following is the best answer?

You would model the current state of business capabilities, value streams,
and the organization map, then revise these models to enable faster time-to-
market, better customer experience, and lower costs. You would create views
that show how the business capabilities, value streams, and information flow
will change in terms of these concerns. Finally, you would identify gaps
between the current and target states to create roadmap components that
must be addressed.

You would use business capabilities, value streams, and information mapping
to determine where the current CRM systems fail to meet customer
expectations, time-to-market, and cost-effectiveness. By applying these
models, you would identify changes to improve customer service, streamline
operations, and reduce costs. You would develop a roadmap with clear
priorities based on the stakeholder requirements, improving the value
stream, capabilities, and information flow.

You would model the business capabilities, value streams, organization map,
and information map following the techniques described in the TOGAF Series
Guides related to Business Architecture. You would use these models to
create an integrated Business Architecture. The gaps between the current
state and the target architecture will highlight where new functionalities
should be implemented or changes are needed. Finally, you would create
architecture views that describe the target state in terms of time-to-market,
customer satisfaction, and cost.

You would focus on where the current business processes-such as
organizational design, business procedures, and locations-fail to meet the
company's objectives for time-to-market, customer satisfaction, and cost
control. You would identify specific changes that would improve service
speed, customer experience, and cost efficiency. Finally, you would assess
whether stakeholders believe the proposed changes are worth the effort and
investment.

Question 6:
Scenario

You are an Enterprise Architect recently hired by a global manufacturing company that has been in operation for over 100 years. The company has expanded through numerous mergers and acquisitions, leading to duplicated systems, inconsistent data, and a reliance on custom-built integrations.

The company has an established Enterprise Architecture team that adopts the TOGAF Standard as the foundation for its practices. The CIO sponsors the Enterprise Architecture program. The IT department is sizable and typically manages over 150 infrastructure and service projects concurrently.

At the latest board meeting, the CEO expressed concern that competitors are leveraging advanced technologies to offer faster production times, lower costs, and enhanced customer experiences through digital platforms.

In response, the CIO has initiated a digital transformation project to revolutionize the company's manufacturing processes. The goal is to implement next-generation manufacturing technologies. She has determined that the company's core infrastructure and services need to be streamlined to support this transformation. The CIO emphasizes that the core infrastructure must be adaptable to continual changes in technology and the business environment.

You have been assigned to the core infrastructure and services project. An Architecture Vision has been approved, allowing the development of a Target Architecture. A set of domain architectures and a gap analysis have been completed and approved by stakeholders. The Enterprise Architecture team has identified the necessary work to implement the changes.

Question

Refer to the Scenario.

You have been asked to recommend the best approach to move forward. Based on the TOGAF Standard, which of the following is the best answer?

You recommend implementing the domain architectures immediately and
adjusting the scopes of all ongoing projects to align with the new
architectures. For requirements from Phases B through D not addressed by
existing projects, you will create new IT projects for each one. You will ensure
all projects expose their data and functionality through defined service interfaces, and that communication strictly uses these interfaces. This plan
will be published as the Implementation and Migration Plan.

You recommend identifying dependencies among the proposed changes and
organizing them into work packages that address the gaps. You will assess
the value, effort, and risk associated with each change and work package, considering stakeholder priorities and preferences. You will identify a series
of Transition Architectures to ensure measurable business value is delivered
incrementally. Work packages and Transition Architectures will be
documented in the Architecture Roadmap.

You recommend gathering input from stakeholders on what needs to be done
to implement the domain architectures, ensuring all stakeholder priorities
and preferences are considered in the planning. This will result in a detailed
list of work activities rolled into an IT portfolio plan, leading to a series of
projects. This comprehensive Target Architecture will include detailed
technology choices for the organization for the next five years.

You recommend that the Enterprise Architecture team reviews existing
projects and deliverables to address the gaps identified in the architecture
domains. Each domain architect will propose specific projects to address
their gaps and consider revising the scope of ongoing projects. The collective
work in each domain will be consolidated into the Implementation and
Migration Plan. The timeline for deliverables will be documented in the
Architecture Roadmap.

Question 7:
Your role is a senior architect working within the Enterprise Architecture (EA) team. Your area of responsibility is the eCommerce website.

Scenario

To date, the EA team has been focused on supporting the firm's IT Portfolio (Architecture to support Portfolio). The EA team has established a strong track record in developing robust architecture frameworks for various departments, including marketing, logistics, inventory management, and customer service platforms. These frameworks ensure seamless operations and integration across the firm's digital infrastructure. The team's efforts have been instrumental in enhancing operational efficiency and enabling data-driven decision-making.

Despite these successes, the EA team has not been involved in defining strategies for the Digital Transformation initiative. Recently, there has been an increasing number of requests from the product development teams and the user experience (UX) team for architecture support. These requests highlight a need for integrating advanced analytics, personalization features, and improved scalability to better serve the growing online customer base. However, the EA team has been referring these experiments to external consultants due to a perceived lack of internal expertise in these specific areas.

Question

You have been asked by the EA team leader to recommend how the EA team could alter its role to support the Digital Transformation activity, specifically focusing on enhancing the eCommerce website's architecture to improve customer engagement and digital marketing capabilities.

Choose the right answer

Since the eCommerce initiatives and platform enhancements are being
developed as experiments, you recommend that each of experimental paths
be considered a portfolio. This approach will fit as an extension of the EA
team's experience in identifying projects, their terms of reference, approach, and synergies. It will help the company balance innovation and efficiency by
providing a structured framework for experimentation while ensuring
alignment with the overall IT strategy and business objectives.

You recommend that the team consider each of the eCommerce initiatives a
solution and a project, and that the EA Team realign to sustain the
enterprise's purpose and value of these experiments. The development of the
eCommerce platform will need to support integration and alignment between
projects. Without constraints, controls, and architecture requirements,
corporate alignment and information integration will be lost.

The eCommerce initiatives and platform enhancements are all being
developed as separate projects. To gain maximum value from these
experiments, you recommend focused attention on their purpose and value.
Furthermore, the development of the eCommerce platform will need to
address synergy and future dependency to support integration and
alignment between projects.

You recommend that the eCommerce website be included within the current
portfolio managed by the EA team since it aligns with other shared core IT
systems and supports the overall business-to-consumer model. This
inclusion will preserve the alignment and information integration that would
otherwise be at risk. By integrating the eCommerce website into the EA
team's portfolio, the team can set constraints and controls to ensure the website's architecture supports advanced analytics, personalization features, and improved scalability.

Question 8:
Scenario Summary:

You are a newly appointed enterprise architect at a global telecommunications company. The company has embarked on a large-scale Digital Innovation program aimed at modernizing legacy systems and integrating more advanced digital services. You have been recruited to help guide the Enterprise Architecture (EA) team through this transformation.

The EA team is facing challenges in aligning digital service initiatives with the company’s traditional service delivery models. Several team members are hesitant to embrace newer digital methods and prefer to rely on past strategies that focused on operational excellence in network management and customer service portfolios.

During a recent strategy session, the EA team leader mentioned that during a webinar, they learned about the value of referencing industry frameworks like the TOGAF Library for relevant case studies and methodologies on digital innovation and transformation.

Question Text:

You have been asked by the EA team leader to assist in demonstrating how the digital service initiatives align with the company's existing service delivery model.

Which of the following is the best course of action?

You advocate for a risk-first approach. Identify the changes with the highest
potential risks and address them first. Organize these changes into work
packages, ensuring that each package has a clear risk mitigation strategy.
Engage stakeholders to prioritize these packages based on business impact.
Develop a series of Transition Architectures that focus on de-risking the most
critical parts of the transformation. The risk assessment, mitigation strategies, and Transition Architectures will be detailed in the Architecture
Roadmap

You would consult the TOGAF Library for relevant resources on digital
transformation and the integration of new digital services. Drawing on
reference architectures and methodologies, you would update the company's
capability model to reflect the digital-first priorities. You would then create a
set of briefing materials highlighting gaps between the company's current
capabilities and those required to support digital services. You would ensure
the material aligns with the style of past EA documents used within the
organization.

You would explain to the EA team that as the company evolves, it encounters
different organizational challenges. You would use the stages described in
the Digital Practitioner Body of Knowledge (DPBoK) to show how the
company should adjust its architectural approach based on its growth phase.
You would also review the team's existing viewpoints to ensure they
incorporate elements that address scaling from the early innovation phase to
full operational integration. Your briefing would illustrate how service
initiatives transition from team-level experiments to enterprise-level
operations.

You suggest a collaborative workshop approach. Organize workshops with
stakeholders from each domain to brainstorm the implementation of domain
architectures. These workshops will ensure that the practical challenges and
nuances of each domain are considered. The insights from these workshops
will lead to a detailed list of work activities, which will be integrated into an IT
portfolio plan. This collaborative approach will culminate in a Target
Architecture that is both visionary and grounded in practical realities.

EXAM 5

Question 1:
Scenario Summary:

You are a senior architect working with the Enterprise Architecture (EA) team at a global financial services company. Your primary responsibility is managing the in-house digital banking platform and aligning it with the company’s strategic goals. Other EA team members are focused on supporting the core banking IT systems and improving customer interaction channels.

The company is advancing its digital transformation, aiming to provide seamless digital financial services alongside its traditional banking products. Your role involves working closely with the digital banking product owners, development teams, and the Chief Technology Officer (CTO) to oversee architecture decisions. In previous architectural projects, you worked with external cloud platforms to develop a reference model for the banking capabilities, data flows, logical application models, and security architecture.

You are currently updating the in-house digital banking roadmap. There are three primary stakeholder groups: the digital banking product managers (focused on speed to market), the operations team (focused on customer satisfaction), and corporate IT (focused on reducing long-term costs). From earlier work on the digital transformation strategy, it was clear that stakeholders were comfortable experimenting with cloud-based solutions but still preferred to retain control over the in-house banking platform. A critical consideration is meeting global regulatory requirements, including data sovereignty for customer information in specific regions.

The EA team leader has met with key stakeholders and confirmed that customer satisfaction goals must be met before any new releases can proceed. However, the current approach consumes significant IT resources, which increases costs, and this issue needs to be addressed.

Question Text:

The EA team leader asks what information you need to gather to address the need to reduce sustained costs.

Which of the following is the best answer?

You would model the current state of the digital banking platform, external
cloud services, and third-party vendor integrations. You would then develop a
revised target architecture that would reduce time-to-market, improve
customer satisfaction, and lower long-term infrastructure costs. This target
architecture would include views that describe the necessary changes to the
digital platform, external services, and any workarounds or optimizations for
third-party systems. Finally, you would document the gaps between the
current and target architectures and create a roadmap for the changes.

You would determine where the application architecture interacts with
customer data, focusing on data regulations needs. You would identify
changes to applications or cloud services to address these concerns. Then,
you would determine whether any changes could improve customer
satisfaction and how they affect the technology architecture. You would
analyze the cost drivers for infrastructure and data systems and calculate the
costs of implementing these changes. Finally, you would consult
stakeholders to evaluate if the proposed changes are worth the investment in
terms of sustained cost.

You would identify where the application architecture fails to support
product time-to-market and customer satisfaction. You would focus on
identifying changes to the information flows to meet regulatory requirements
and ensure customer data residency. You would also determine what needs to
change in the technology architecture to enable these improvements. Finally,
you would identify changes that impact sustained infrastructure costs and
gather the priorities of the stakeholders related to enhancing business
capabilities, improving data flows, and streamlining operations.

You would determine where the application and data architecture fail to meet
expectations for product time-to-market and customer satisfaction. You
would focus on changes to the information flows that could improve both
areas while also driving down infrastructure costs. Once identified, you would
assess the priorities of the stakeholders in relation to application, data management, and infrastructure improvements. Finally, you would estimate
the cost of implementing these changes in the application and data
architecture, considering both the in-house platform and external
integrations.

Question 2:
Scenario Summary:

You are a senior architect working with the Enterprise Architecture (EA) team at a global insurance company. The company is undergoing a digital transformation, aiming to enhance its existing insurance products with digital services and streamline operations across different markets.

You are leading a project to update the Claims Processing System Roadmap, expanding its scope to include automated digital claims services. Several members of your team are focusing on individual business processes, operational workflows, technical capabilities, and the limitations of various system solutions. IT stakeholders are concerned that the digital experiments might evolve into permanent solutions that don’t align with the core architecture. Meanwhile, the product owners worry about the long-term implications of these changes and how they will impact the company's ability to handle claims effectively.

As part of the roadmap development, you refer to the Digital Insurance Strategy architecture, which serves as the guiding framework. You are creating a roadmap that outlines key system components, their alignment to various business and technical models, and the gaps between the current system and future targets.

[Note: key components refer to business processes, logical software components, data flows, technical solutions, etc.]

Question Text:
The EA team leader asks how you plan to continue developing the Claims Processing System Roadmap.

Which of the following is the best answer?

You would create necessary views that help stakeholders understand the
benefits of an automated claims processing system. This will address the IT stakeholders' concerns regarding whether the digital solutions will be
scalable. You identify gaps in the Digital Insurance Strategy that indicate the
need for an integrated claims system. You quantify the business value of
creating incremental steps that deliver value. You then group these gaps and
the work packages needed to address them. Finally, you consolidate the work
packages into transition states that lead to a claims processing system.

You would create views that address your team's concerns to ensure they
fully understand the value of different system features and technical
components. You identify gaps in the superior architecture that must be
addressed, regardless of the current stakeholder preferences. You quantify
the business value and the effort required to reach key points of realization.
For each work package, you identify whether it involves evolutionary,
revolutionary, or greenfield changes. Finally, you consolidate the work
packages into transition states that provide enough value to justify the effort.

You would create views that align IT and product stakeholders' concerns and
objectives. Using these views, you agree on a value delivery timeline. You
identify gaps in the Digital Insurance Strategy that must be addressed,
regardless of preferences, and quantify the business value and effort needed
for incremental outcomes. You group the gaps into work packages, then
collaborate with stakeholders to determine whether the approach should be
revolutionary, evolutionary, or greenfield. Finally, you consolidate the work
packages into transition states that provide value to justify investments

You would create views that help your stakeholders understand the flexibility
to pursue different claims processing models. You identify objectives in the
superior architecture that emphasize flexibility and experimentation. You link
these objectives to different operational models. You quantify the business
value and work required to reach key incremental goals. You then group the
gaps and work packages, emphasizing an evolutionary approach to minimize rework. Finally, you consolidate the work packages into transition states that
efficiently support the digital claims processing system.

Question 3:
You are a lead architect working within the Enterprise Architecture (EA) team at the multinational healthcare firm, HealthConnect Inc. Your area of responsibility is the Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system.



Scenario

You see the need to develop a new target architecture for the CRM, since the current roadmap doesn’t include support for the digital transformation, which is adding digital health services and telemedicine. Several of the product managers have raised concerns about poor patient engagement and would like to know what the options are to improve it. They have also voiced a concern that the physical health services and digital health services will not be completely distinct in terms of the sales and support channel.



During discussions with the Product Managers, concerns raised include time-to-market, innovation, efficiency, and risks from integrated and product-centric systems. It appears there are conflicting and contradictory positions about their needs and how to move forward.



Question

You have been asked how an architected approach will help resolve conflict and lead to an improvement in patient engagement and relationship management?

Choose the best answer.

You explain that an architected approach starts by ensuring the problem is
clearly defined. You will identify stakeholders with interests that are
fundamental to the problem being addressed and identify decisions that
have already been made. You would develop an Architecture Vision that
answers the problem and addresses the stakeholder interests. You will then
obtain the agreement of the stakeholders to proceed.

You explain that an architected approach would be based on the knowledge
and experience of the product managers who are closest to the patient
engagement. You will use the same approach that builds the existing CRM
roadmap, bringing together competing interests between enterprise resources and the product lines. You will ensure that decisions are made based on value and the resources necessary to deliver that value.

You explain that an architected approach will start by narrowing down the
problem to one that can be reasonably answered and acted upon. You will identify the key stakeholders with interests in the problem. You then develop
and propose a summary answer to the problem. You ensure the stakeholders
understand what the next steps will be and when changes will take place.

You explain that the architected approach would be based on the existing
CRM architecture since that is the current baseline. You would extend the
approach used to build the existing roadmap for the CRM system, which
addresses competing product line demands and the capacity of enterprise
resources. The extension would serve digital health services. This is a
reasonable compromise to address current and future product needs.

Question 4:
Scenario Summary:

You are the Lead Architect for a global retail company that manages both physical and online operations. The company is undergoing a significant transformation to modernize its e-commerce platform and improve online customer engagement. Currently, the e-commerce system does not provide sufficient functionality to support personalized marketing campaigns and targeted promotions, which has been resulting in missed revenue opportunities.

To address this, the company plans to implement a Commercial Off-the-Shelf (COTS) Customer Analytics solution from a well-known vendor. The company’s CIO is the sponsor of the Enterprise Architecture practice, which follows the TOGAF Standard.

The Enterprise Architecture team has conducted a business process analysis to define the requirements for the new system, and a proposed architecture has been reviewed by the Architecture Board. This solution is capable of integrating with existing systems, but it requires a non-standard database platform that is not currently supported by the company's infrastructure. The initial costs of this approach seem low, but concerns have been raised about long-term support, maintenance, and integration challenges.

The CIO is eager to implement the COTS solution quickly to stay competitive, and has approved the project roadmap. A project manager has been appointed to lead the implementation, and the CIO has stressed the importance of staying within budget while maintaining system performance and security.
Question Text:

You have been asked to recommend a plan to implement the CIO’s direction. Based on the TOGAF Standard, which of the following is the best answer?

You would prepare a detailed risk assessment for the use of the non-standard
database platform and inform the implementation team of the required
deliverables and deployment timelines. You prepare an impact analysis on
using this platform, then create an Architecture Contract and seek approval
from the CIO. You schedule a final test of the solution just before deployment
to ensure it meets performance requirements. After implementation, you archive the project artifacts in the Architecture Repository.

You review the Architecture Board's feedback and recommend accepting the
use of the non-standard database platform, noting the need to train staff. You
add this database platform to the company's organizational standards. You
work with the project architects to draft an Architecture Contract for the implementation team, emphasizing the importance of compliance reviews
throughout the implementation. You also ensure that test plans are created to
monitor performance and security, and establish SLAs with the business unit.
After implementation, you document reusable components for future.

Based on the feedback from the Architecture Board, you recommend that the
vendor modify the database components of the COTS solution to meet the
company's infrastructure standards. You propose developing a prototype to
test how the COTS solution integrates with other in-house systems. You
would seek approval from internal development teams to support the
implementation, then develop an Architecture Contract, emphasizing
adherence to the project timeline. After the implementation, you would
schedule regular operational reviews to monitor the system's performance.

Based on the Architecture Board's concerns, you would eliminate the non-
standard database platform from the solution and develop a new architecture
that uses standard components. You inform the ClO that this will reduce
long-term costs, despite a higher initial investment. You create a new
Architecture Contract and present the revised plan to the finance committee.
You also schedule regular project management meetings to ensure the
solution adheres to company standards.

Question 5:
You are a solutions architect working within the Enterprise Architecture (EA) team at the multinational telecommunications firm, TeleNet Inc. Your area of responsibility is the customer self-service platform.



Scenario

Within your personal area of responsibility, the customer self-service platform, you see the need to develop a new target architecture. The old drivers of efficiency and extending localized customer support services do not directly support the Digital Transformation. You know that there are fundamental customer engagement changes required to support the Digital Transformation.



Several of the Product Managers (responsible for both traditional telecom services and new digital services) have raised concerns about poor customer engagement with the new experimental digital services and would like to know what the options are to improve it. They have also voiced a concern that in the future, the traditional and digital services will not be completely distinct in terms of the sales and support channel.



Question

You have been asked by the EA team leader how you plan to set up the architecture development project?



Which of the following is the best answer?

You will help the product managers understand the options to create a
company-wide solution covering both traditional and digital services or a
service-centric solution. You will resolve this question for the product
managers before proceeding. You define a Stakeholder Map for the key
stakeholders who you identify as the product managers. You recognize that
you need external assistance for the project. You will engage with digital
services subject matter experts to help fill in the details of direct-to-
consumer digital services and third-party platform customer engagement.

You will confirm the project scope, determining whether it is digital services
only or company-wide, and what the planning horizon is. You need to know
where the project will fit in the business cycle, for example, will it align with
the budget cycle in the customer self-service platform. You will identify who
all the key stakeholders are and their issues. Since this is outside your
experience which has been focused on IT-centric portfolio-based work, you
will seek assistance with digital services and customer engagement.

You will explain to the product managers that this is a company-wide
initiative covering both digital services and traditional services. You will align
the project to the customer self-service platform roadmap timeline to
support the budget cycle. You will confirm that the key stakeholders are the
product managers, operational executives, and someone representing
corporate systems and IT. You will identify stakeholder concerns and
requirements. You will seek guidance and assistance from a subject matter
expert since digital services and customer experience are outside your IT-
centric work.

You will explain to the product managers the available options for extending
the existing enterprise customer self-service platform to include the addition
of digital services. You will confirm a project timeline that fits with the
customer self-service platform roadmap and budget cycle. You will engage
the same stakeholders as identified by the Stakeholder Map used by the
customer self-service platform roadmap. You know you will need to engage
with digital services subject matter experts to help fill in the details of direct-
to-consumer digital services and third-party platform interfaces.

Question 6:
You are a solutions architect working with the Enterprise Architecture (EA) team at the multinational financial services firm, FinWealth Solutions Inc. You are responsible for the customer relationship management (CRM) roadmap at the portfolio level. The initial experiments of the Digital Transformation have been successful. The organization has successfully delivered digital financial products. One of the experiments is now delivering 10% of corporate revenue.



You are developing the annual update for the CRM roadmap. When you started the annual update, your most important objectives were to improve overall efficiency and sustain the unique value proposition of each financial product line.



During the work to develop the roadmap, a decision has been taken to transition the successful digital financial product from running as an experiment to sustained operation. This product uses an AI-bot, chat, and email-based CRM that provides direct customer engagement for sales and support. You understand the system was hastily assembled from third-party tools and workarounds. The system has serious customer information limitations and cannot be used globally.



Question Text

What would you do next?

Which of the following is the best answer?

You would continue developing your work plan to ensure you meet
expectations for the CRM roadmap. You would initiate a separate architecture
project to address the CRM solution for the digital product.

You would assess the impact of extending the enterprise CRM to include a
sustained global CRM capability encompassing the former experimental
product. You would create a Requirements Impact Assessment to identify the
changes that should be made and the implications of them, and submit that to the Architecture Board.

You would confirm with your stakeholders whether the change in status of
the digital product has impacted the scope, stakeholders, and the objectives
for your work. Based on stakeholder direction, you adjust your current
architecture project.

You would confirm with the Architecture Board if the change in status of the
digital product to running as a sustained operation impacts the scope of your current work on the annual update to the roadmap. If so, then you will adjust
your current architecture project in alignment with the direction from the Architecture Board.

Question 7:
You are an Enterprise Architecture Specialist advising the Lead Architect of a division within a global automotive manufacturing company. This division is renowned for its innovative electric vehicles (EVs) that have set new standards in terms of range and efficiency. The corporation is in the final stages of acquiring a startup known for its cutting-edge battery technology, which promises to revolutionize the EV market by significantly reducing charging times.



The corporation has a robust Enterprise Architecture practice that underpins all its global operations. The TOGAF Standard serves as the foundational framework for this practice. While each division enjoys a degree of autonomy in its operations, they all adhere to the overarching architectural principles and guidelines set by the corporation.



To ensure a smooth integration of the startup's technology, a new Enterprise Architecture initiative has been launched within the division. As this initiative transitions into Phase A, the scope has been defined, emphasizing the need for a seamless technological merger. The Lead Architect has stressed the importance of ensuring that the new technology is not only integrated but also well-received across the entire division. She recalls previous integrations where the lack of stakeholder buy-in led to suboptimal outcomes.



**Question**



Refer to the Scenario.



You are tasked with proposing a strategy that would guarantee the successful integration of the startup's technology, addressing the Lead Architect's concerns. Based on the TOGAF Standard, which of the following would be your recommendation?

• You would conduct a series of business scenarios with the stakeholders
impacted by the acquisition, and determine which stakeholders are likely to block the initiative and which are likely to support it. This would let you identify and understand business needs and derive the business
requirements that the architecture development has to address. You would
identify the most relevant architecture viewpoints and validate with the
stakeholders.

You would conduct a pilot project as part of Phase A to demonstrate to the
stakeholders the technical feasibility of the approaches that are available
from your preferred suppliers. You would map the possible solutions to a viewpoint library. Once the stakeholders confirm the approach meets their
requirements, you would then complete a Statement of Work and issue an
Architecture Contract to your suppliers.

You would identify key stakeholders across both the current division and the
new acquisition. You would classify their positions and influence, recording
the results in a stakeholder map. You would then focus on key stakeholders
ensuring that you identify the most relevant architecture viewpoints for each
stakeholder and validate that their concerns are being addressed. You would
communicate with stakeholders early and frequently, ensuring that they fully
understand the architecture process.

You would focus on communications with the stakeholders at the new
acquisition as effective communication of targeted information to the right
stakeholders at the right time is a critical success factor for such a merger.
You would develop a Communications Plan, which would allow you to plan
and manage the process. It would ensure that stakeholders are aware of the
key features of the architecture and have the opportunity to comment.

Question 8:
Scenario Summary:

You are the Lead Architect for a global manufacturing company that has recently expanded through the acquisition of two regional manufacturing firms. The company is undergoing a significant Enterprise Architecture initiative to unify its operations, streamline supply chain processes, and integrate IT systems across all regions.

The company's leadership has decided to follow the TOGAF Standard, with a strong focus on the Architecture Development Method (ADM). A new Chief Technology Officer (CTO) has been appointed as the sponsor of the Enterprise Architecture program, tasked with delivering a unified IT infrastructure that supports both the manufacturing and distribution networks.

An outline Implementation and Migration Plan has been approved, and now detailed planning is underway to create a comprehensive migration strategy. Key conversations with stakeholders have focused on balancing value, effort, and risk, while ensuring that budget constraints are met.

It's important to note that the Enterprise Architecture team is not the sole party responsible for building, funding, and maintaining the new IT systems; these responsibilities will also be shared by the acquired companies' regional teams. The company's market is competitive, and delays in integration or inefficiencies in the supply chain could severely impact profitability.

The CTO has emphasized the importance of reducing risk and demonstrating quick wins. As a result, the integration program will be rolled out incrementally, delivering value with each step to ensure business continuity and performance improvements.

Question Text:

You have been asked to describe how the detailed Implementation and Migration Plan should be created. Based on the TOGAF Standard, which of the following is the best answer?

The migration planning should be led by the Enterprise Architecture team,
especially the domain architects, who will define a series of Transition
Architectures. These architectures will deliver incremental value. A prioritized
list of activities will be created to realize the Transition Architectures,
documented in the Implementation and Migration Plan, and supported by a
detailed schedule in the Architecture Roadmap. This plan will be shared with
business leaders and the executive team for funding approval.

You would lead the migration planning activity in coordination with the
domain architects, finalizing the Implementation and Migration Plan. The plan will include a list of prioritized projects, their estimated cost, effort, and
schedule. Feedback from the Architecture Board will be incorporated to
refine the plan before submission. The plan would also contain a sequenced
timeline that will serve as the Architecture Roadmap.

Migration planning should be conducted by the project managers, using the
Implementation and Migration Strategy from Phase E to create project plans.
These plans will focus on scope, budget, and time constraints. The project
managers will prioritize projects with the highest business value and request
funding from the Architecture Board. Approved projects and their associated
roadmaps will form the basis of the detailed Implementation and Migration
Plan.

The business planning, operations, and portfolio management teams should
collaborate with the Enterprise Architecture team to perform the migration
planning. You would create detailed resource estimates for the work, and
identify business value for all deliverables. A series of Transition Architectures will be planned, taking into account stakeholder priorities.
Once the Transition Architectures are finalized, the Implementation and
Migration Plan can be developed. When the deliverables are complete, the architecture cycle can proceed.

EXAM 6

Question 1:
Scenario Summary:
You are a senior architect working with the Enterprise Architecture (EA) team at a multinational technology company. The company is undergoing a large-scale digital transformation, enabling all of its product lines to offer digital services alongside their existing physical products.

Recently, you completed a significant update to the company's customer management strategy, expanding it to include digital services. As part of this update, you implemented a transition architecture to sustain the core global CRM, while allowing specific digital teams to manage their own CRM systems. Key elements of your architecture include strategies for phasing out legacy systems, global security protocols, and protection of the company’s digital brand identity.

During a strategy meeting, the EA team leader brings up a critical issue regarding one of the external platforms being used for digital services. The platform, which includes a high-performing AI assistant, is found to have compliance issues related to user data privacy and regional regulations. The AI assistant has been instrumental in increasing customer engagement and boosting sales by 35% month-over-month. However, to protect the company’s brand and legal standing, the leadership team is considering halting product development on this platform until a solution is found. They are eager to salvage the digital product and maintain its success.

Question Text: The EA team leader informs you that the product team is fully available for consultation and requests you to summarize the next steps for advising the key stakeholders.
Which of the following is the best answer?

The system choices include adopting a new platform, making a revolutionary
change to the in-house platform, or adapting the product for either of the
available platforms. You should refer to the transition architecture as it
accounts for data protection, brand integrity, and exiting from disposable
systems. A crucial factor is assessing the current workload and capability of
the in-house team. You will visually document the risks, opportunities, and
required work for each option to help stakeholders make an informed
decision.

The system choices involve making revolutionary changes to either align the
digital product with your in-house platform or migrate it to another third-
party platform. A major consideration is the potential to enhance the in-house
platform to maximize the value of this opportunity. The product team must
recognize that a revolutionary transformation is needed to accommodate
either platform. This is a strong opportunity to advance your in-house
capabilities with both Al technology and enhanced analytics that could be
useful in future projects.

The system choices include using a greenfield approach with a completely
new platform, undertaking a revolutionary change to the in-house platform,
or radically modifying the product to work with either of the two available
platforms. You advise that an evolutionary approach is not suitable in this
case. A significant consideration will be the available resources of the in-
house platform team. Each choice presents different levels of risk and
opportunity, and you will document these for stakeholders.

The system choices involve either a revolutionary change to integrate the
product with the in-house platform or using another third-party platform. A
key concern is the current capacity and resources of the in-house platform
team. Although it would be beneficial to extend the in-house platform, the
risks are too high as the product team has primarily worked with commercial
platforms, and the in-house system lacks mature processes and
documentation. You should document the option of transitioning to the other
third-party platform.

Question 2:
You are a new solutions architect working within the Enterprise Architecture (EA) team at a multinational energy company, EnergySolutions Inc. You have joined the EA team while it is in transition to better support the Digital Transformation. You have experience with digital services and have been hired to extend the capability of the EA team.

Scenario

The EA team is now engaged in the Digital Transformation initiative, and an architecture has been developed to support the strategy, with a supporting roadmap. The team has initiated work into the architecting of service delivery processes and customer experience.

Within your personal area of responsibility, the Customer Management System (CMS), you are working to develop an architecture that supports a radically different customer experience and engagement model. For example, the old CMS workflows assume that service issues must be reported via phone and an on-site visit scheduled for resolution. This assumption is not valid for digital energy monitoring services or remote diagnostics.

You have identified the following stakeholders and concerns (drawn from the TOGAF Series Guide: A Practitioners’ Approach to Developing Enterprise Architecture Following the TOGAF® ADM, Appendices B & C):

(Customer) Traditional energy service customer

(Customer) Digital energy service customer

(Business Partner) Traditional energy service distributor

(Business Requirements Owner) Call-center Operations Leaders

Two of your core Architecture Concerns are:

Change Impact (Business Partner & Business Requirements Owner)

Value Proposition (Customer & Business Requirements Owner)

You are going to identify deficiencies in your current customer engagement from the perspective of each stakeholder, then identify changes that will address the deficiencies. You will then identify any changes that conflict or create a deficiency for a different stakeholder.

For each of the changes that is in conflict or creates a new deficiency, you will perform analysis to put the conflict in comparable terms of value delivery, work, and uncertainty to achieve the value.

[Note: The EA team has adopted the role definitions in the TOGAF Series Guide: A Practitioners’ Approach to Developing Enterprise Architecture Following the TOGAF® ADM, Section 15.2]

Question

You have been asked how you will address conflict in preferences for customer engagement ?

You will focus on facilitating between the different stakeholders to gain an
understanding of value preference and priority as well as the scope of
change. You will use stakeholder agents for the customer and business partner. Conflict within one stakeholder's preferences is resolved with that
stakeholder. Conflict between stakeholders will be resolved by reference to
the superior architecture, or by relaxing one or more preferences until an
acceptable answer is reached.

You will focus on the choices based on your understanding of the superior
architecture. You will use reference material from the TOGAF Library,
including the white paper, the Seven Levers of Digital Transformation, to
provide external guidance of items that are critical for success, notably
Customer Experience and Engagement. Conflict between stakeholders will
be resolved in priority of the customer, business requirements owners, and
then business partners.

You will focus on facilitating understanding of value, work to realize, and risk
of failing. You will use the service product owners to provide decisions when
there is a trade-off to make between preferences of the customers and
business partners. Conflict between stakeholders will be resolved either by
superior architecture providing a priority to a stakeholder or concern, or by
relaxing one or more preferences until you reach an acceptable answer.

You will focus on pushing to resolve each conflict and produce an answer. You
draw up a Stakeholder/Concern matrix using the existing Stakeholder Map
from the CMS architecture. You will also use the existing CMS architecture to
provide constraining decisions and set priorities for addressing conflicts
between stakeholder preferences. Conflict between stakeholder preferences
will be resolved in priority of the importance of the stakeholder as identified
in the Stakeholder Map.

Question 3:
Scenario Summary:

You are an architect within the Enterprise Architecture (EA) team at a global home improvement retailer with over 200 stores, primarily selling hardware and building supplies. After steady growth and successful brick-and-mortar operations, the Board of Directors has approved a plan to expand into direct online sales. Previously, online orders were handled through third-party marketplaces, but now the company aims to create its own e-commerce platform.

To accomplish this, an Enterprise Architecture project has been launched to plan and manage the transition. The Board has set an aggressive 24-month timeline for the first phase, which focuses on establishing a functional online sales system for 30 pilot stores. The project needs to evaluate how the existing physical infrastructure and business processes can be adapted for digital operations.

The company uses the TOGAF Standard as its Enterprise Architecture framework. The CIO sponsors the project.

The key architecture domains have been developed, and stakeholders generally agree on the tasks needed for the transition. A Baseline Business Architecture already exists, which includes business capabilities, process flows, and a value stream map. A critical issue for the project is migrating from a store-centric inventory system to one that can handle online orders and fulfillment.

The CIO has raised the option of purchasing a Commercial Off-the-Shelf (COTS) solution from a well-established e-commerce provider. However, there are concerns about how well the packaged solution will integrate with the retailer's existing infrastructure.

Question Text:

The EA team leader asks you to explain how you will identify the required changes in the Business Architecture. Based on the TOGAF Standard, which of the following is the best answer?

You would model the current business state using techniques such as value
streams, business capabilities, and organization maps. You would focus on
enhancing the existing business capabilities and value streams as outlined in
the baseline architecture. This would enable you to identify where changes
are required to meet the Target Architecture

You would request detailed documentation from the vendor about the COTS
solution and identify the changes required to align it with your current
systems. You would sequence the necessary changes into an Architecture
Roadmap and ensure value is delivered incrementally. You would also contact
other users of the solution to verify whether the vendor can meet your
delivery timeline and service requirements.

You would review the current architecture descriptions to ensure they reflect
the existing state of the enterprise. Then, you would develop architecture
descriptions for the Target Architecture, including new value streams for
online sales. You would create a capability map linked to those value streams
and perform a gap analysis to determine which capabilities need to change.

You would determine where the business processes, organizational
structure, and current capabilities do not support the proposed digital
expansion. This would allow you to identify the necessary changes and the
work required to implement them. You would present the change options to
stakeholders, providing an analysis of the costs involved. You would also
identify where trade-off decisions are necessary and collaborate with
stakeholders to resolve them.

Question 4:
Scenario Summary

You are a senior architect working with the Enterprise Architecture (EA) team at the multinational healthcare firm, MediHealth Inc. You are responsible for the CRM roadmap at the portfolio level. The initial experiments of the Digital Transformation have been successful. The organization has successfully delivered digital health services. One of the experiments is now delivering 10% of corporate revenue and is projected to grow 100% this year.

The system supporting the most successful digital product is the online chat/email-based contact center that is integrated with the go-forward digital platform. This solution was hastily assembled from a mixture of commercial applications and SaaS tools. It has limited support for data analytics, marketing, promotions, and patient engagement.

You have completed delivery of your annual CRM roadmap. The projects to improve efficiency have been approved, and one of the projects to extend the system into a new country to support the unique local needs of healthcare regulations is completing. Between the work to develop the annual roadmap and provide implementation governance to the expansion into a new country, you have been very busy. Looking forward, one of the efficiency improvement projects will be very complex with significant process and system changes to enable chat and email contact with the customer service agents.

Question Text

You meet with the EA Team leader to discuss the status of your work. She notes that neither you nor the EA Team can sustain how the experiments were handled. She asks what you are going to change to ensure you and the team can meet expectations?

Which of the following is the best answer?


You explain that you are going to improve the documentation and support
available to the implementation team, particularly for the Architecture
Requirements Specification and controls. The work to document these
artifacts will pay off later in the project timeline, by providing purpose and
constraints on the implementation team. As soon as the Project and Solution
Delivery-level artifacts have been provided to the implementation team, you
will be free to focus on developing a target architecture for a combined
digital/physical healthcare world.

You explain that improving sustainability requires not building technical debt
right now. When the company followed a strategy of enabling experiments, they created an ad hoc coordination burden. Due to the complex situation, it
is better to deal with the technical debt as soon as possible, and address it at
the architecture level. You must stay directly engaged in implementation
governance of these projects. You will guide the addition of chat and email to
the global system so the CRM architecture can better support digital
products.

You explain that the best approach given the situation is for you to stop work
on the CRM Roadmap and focus entirely on implementation governance for
the major efficiency project. Adding chat and email to the global system is
going to have major process, staffing, and system implications. It will be
important to support solution delivery by providing the controls and
architecture requirements used to test conformance. You will also facilitate
governance of the implementation and operational changes.

You explain that you are going to need support to ensure you have the gaps,
work packages, Architecture Requirements Specification, and controls
documented so that you do not need to be directly engaged in the
implementation project. The digital product changes and ad hoc approaches
in this experimental phase are creating barriers to future support of digital
health services. You are going to need to focus on developing a target
architecture for a combined digital/physical healthcare world. The
stakeholders will need to bring together the resources to manage change.

Question 5:
Scenario Summary:
You are a senior architect working with the Enterprise Architecture (EA) team at a global retail company. The company is undergoing a major digital transformation initiative to bring all its product offerings online, alongside its physical sales channels. The scope of your work includes a comprehensive update to the customer relationship management (CRM) system to support digital products. The approved transition architecture allows the core CRM to continue operating while digital teams are responsible for implementing their own systems for customer interactions.

Key architectural guidelines include:

Phasing out temporary, experimental systems.

Adhering to global information security and data protection standards.

Ensuring alignment with the company’s global brand standards.

There are several implementation teams involved in the rollout:

A central in-house platform team.

Two customer engagement product teams working on direct-to-consumer products.

Three teams responsible for third-party platforms that integrate with internal systems.

Question Text: The EA team leader has asked how you will manage collaboration with the various implementation teams to ensure they align with the transition architecture.

Which of the following is the best answer?

You will publish the final Architecture Requirements Specifications, along
with guidelines and conformance tests, to a shared repository so that all
teams can access them. You will regularly check in with the teams to ensure
progress and verify that they are meeting the architecture's specifications.
The teams will also be required to ensure interoperability and compliance
with the defined requirements.

You will collaborate with each implementation team to update the
Architecture Requirements Specification and conformance tests to fit their
individual development roadmaps. You will establish timelines with the
development teams and schedule follow-up meetings to check on progress.
These follow-ups will be aligned with specific milestones in their
implementation schedules. You will ensure reporting aligns with the
governance process connected to the development timeline.

You will ensure that each implementation team understands the applicable
Architecture Requirements Specifications. Using the timeline established by
the transition architecture, you will identify the deadlines for implementation
and follow up with each team accordingly. Progress will be reported through
the governance process based on the predetermined schedule.

You will work with each implementation team to re-draft the Architecture
Requirements Specifications and conformance tests to fit within their
development plans. You will collaborate with the development teams and
stakeholders to agree on a timeline for rolling out the new architecture. You
will be available for regular follow-ups to ensure alignment, assist with
interpreting the architecture, and adjust conformance tests to fit their
specific implementations. You will also ensure reporting is done through the established governance process.


Question 6:
Scenario Summary:
You are a senior architect working with the Enterprise Architecture (EA) team at a multinational consumer electronics firm. You are responsible for the product lifecycle management (PLM) roadmap at the portfolio level.

Within your area of responsibility, the PLM system, you see the need to develop a new target architecture. The old drivers of operational efficiency and localization of product warranties no longer fully support the firm’s Digital Transformation. The traditional workflows assumed products were handled through physical inspections for refunds and replacements. This will no longer be feasible as the company shifts to digital products and services, requiring new engagement models and automated processes.
You are attending a meeting with the EA team to discuss strategy changes. The EA team is evolving from its IT-centric focus to a broader engagement in customer experience for digital products. You have reviewed materials from the TOGAF Library, including best practices for digital transformation, to help prepare for this meeting. The EA team leader emphasizes the need to ensure the organization’s Enterprise Architecture capability is aligned with the firm’s changing digital strategy.

Question Text:
During the meeting, the EA team leader asks you how you plan to update your approach to the PLM roadmap. She also notes that the approach should maintain continuity with existing analyses but address the evolving needs of the digital strategy at a portfolio level.

What is your answer, and where would you seek guidance?

You would frame trade-offs between retaining a single shared product-
master repository versus creating product-line-specific repositories. Each
path has implications for data integration, duplication, and IP protection. You
will develop a candidate architecture and capability-gap analysis so
executives can judge the opportunities and risks, shaping enterprise-wide decisions on product-data governance.

You would immediately design a radically new PLM architecture because the current shared model "won't work" for mixed physical-digital offerings. You would also redesign the EA Repository/meta-model from scratch and rely on
the TOGAF® Information Architecture guide to integrate all downstream
service platforms and mitigate personal-data risks.

You would broaden your existing risk analysis to cover uncertainties
introduced by digital product lifecycles. As product usage and telemetry data
multiply across new touchpoints, you will evaluate information-security and
compliance risks, define success metrics for product-usage engagement,
and identify capability gaps in the PLM landscape.
For guidance you will consult the TOGAF® Library's Digital Business
Reference Model and Seven Levers of Digital Transformation, which address
data-driven product innovation, secure sharing of product information, and
governance at portfolio scale.

You would address product data security by reworking the EA Repository and
meta-model to handle more detailed data capture across multiple lifecycle
stages and digital touchpoints. By applying controls for data interchange and
protection across the PLM ecosystem, you'll reduce security risks. The PLM
platform will need enhancements to support digital product characteristics
(like software versions, usage data), and you will guide improvements as the
digital product strategies stabilize.

Question 7:
Scenario Summary:

You are a senior architect on the Enterprise Architecture (EA) team at a multinational electronics firm. You are responsible for overseeing the Customer Experience (CX) roadmap at a portfolio level. The early stages of the company's digital transformation have gone well, with digital services making significant strides. One of these new digital services, an AI-based support chatbot, now accounts for 15% of the company's customer interactions and is expected to grow rapidly.

The current system, which manages this successful digital product, integrates a mixture of legacy tools and modern software-as-a-service (SaaS) applications. However, it was rapidly deployed and lacks sufficient functionality for analytics, marketing automation, and sales integration. You have just wrapped up the annual update to the CX roadmap, and several projects aimed at optimizing the system for better performance and scaling have been approved. One project is focused on extending this system to a new region to accommodate local compliance and customer support requirements. Looking ahead, the next wave of improvements will require substantial updates to enable seamless integration of email and chat support for global customer service operations.

Question Text:

You are in a meeting with the EA Team leader, who asks about your progress and your proposed next steps for the Customer Experience roadmap. How do you envision your role in this process moving forward?

Which of the following is the best answer?

You explain that the next year will be very demanding. Integrating chat and
email into the global support system will require substantial process, staffing, and system changes. You expect to be heavily involved in
implementation governance and, with these new capabilities, may expand
the CX architecture to better align with digital services.

You explain that it's important to first gather feedback from stakeholders
regarding their priorities, preferences, and value assessments. Without this
input, you may become too focused on managing the process and resource
challenges of integrating chat and email, leaving little time to strategize
around future CX architecture improvements.

You explain that the next year will involve managing a heavy workload. The
integration of chat and email will have significant implications for staffing,
processes, and systems. While overseeing implementation governance, you
plan to engage with CX stakeholders to decide on the appropriate timing for
expanding the architecture to better support digital products.

) You explain that your focus will need to be on implementation governance for
the upcoming complex project, especially adding email and chat integration.
This project will require major changes to staffing, process flows, and system infrastructure. Based on lessons learned from last year's roadmap cycle, you plan to begin the roadmap update process earlier this time.

Question 8:
Scenario

You are an Architect working with the Enterprise Architecture team for a government health services agency. The agency is responsible for building online digital platforms, products, and services that help create a simple, integrated, and personalized healthcare experience for its end users. Programs are funded in an annual budget cycle, and legislation aimed at controlling IT costs mandates the use of a shared government Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) and common systems.

The Enterprise Architecture team uses the TOGAF Standard as the basis for its practice and reports directly to the Executive Director of the agency.

The team is engaged in a major initiative to develop an electronic health records (EHR) system for use in future local and national healthcare facilities. This system will supplement current methods of maintaining health records, including paper files and disparate electronic systems. It will allow patients to access their health records via the Internet.

Ensuring patient data privacy and security is a key challenge. The Enterprise Architecture team leader has returned from a meeting where it was revealed that an individual can currently have multiple incompatible health records within different government agencies. Concerns around data breaches, security risks, and privacy violations were discussed, as well as worries that certain groups might be excluded due to technology requirements. It was noted that four agencies have been attempting to unify health records for several years but have made little progress.

The Information Architect within the team has identified two options for managing health records. At first glance, the options appear to be competing. The first is to introduce a new centralized health record system optimized for the EHR initiative; the second is to develop a federated model for health records that can also support existing records across multiple agencies.

Question

Refer to the Scenario.

You have been asked by the Enterprise Architecture team leader how you would select the best option for the EHR initiative. Based on the TOGAF Standard, which of the following is the best answer?

You would start by identifying the key stakeholders and their concerns. You
assess the impact of the 2 options in each architecture domain. In addition to
collaborating with other domain architects, you will work with subject matter
experts in the EHR initiative and the four agencies. You will evaluate the
implications regarding the program's ability to meet its objectives, as well as
risks and security concerns in all domain Architectures. You will facilitate the
stakeholders in selecting their preferred option by balancing different
concerns, required changes, costs, and benefits.

You would start by identifying the EHR initiative's stakeholders and leads
from the four agencies. Working with key subject matter experts involved in
information and digital service implementation, you will assess the two
options. Together with these experts, you will use the architecture trade-off
method to define alternatives based on the options. After listing the
advantages and disadvantages of each, you will select the best option,
integrate it into the Implementation and Migration Plan, explain it to
stakeholders and agency leads, and oversee its implementation.

You would begin by identifying the stakeholders and key subject matter
experts deeply involved in data management. Recognizing that many
stakeholders undervalue and under-engage in information-based issues, you
will need to find stakeholder agents. You will assess the impact of the options
on the EHR initiative and existing systems at the 4 agencies. Collaborating
with subject matter experts in the EHR initiative and the 4 impacted
agencies, you will assess security concerns for both the federated and new
centralized system. You will then select the best option and propose it.

You would start by identifying the new digital service's stakeholders and their
concerns. Using the TOGAF Series Guide: "A Practitioner's Approach to..." as a
starting point for stakeholder concerns, you assess the impact of the 2
options on the EHR initiative and existing IT systems at the 4 agencies.
Collaborating with subject matter experts in the EHR initiative and the 4
impacted agencies, you will assess security concerns in all domain
Architectures. You will work with stakeholders to balance different concerns,
required changes, costs, and benefits, allowing them to select an option.
